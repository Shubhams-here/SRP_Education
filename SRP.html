        <h2>Indus Valley Civilization</h2>
        <ul>
            <li class="liheading">
                Introduction:
            </li>
            <p>
                The Indus Valley Civilization, also known as the Harappan Civilization, stands as a testament to the ancient roots of human civilization in the Indian subcontinent. Flourishing from approximately 3300 BCE to 1300 BCE, this enigmatic culture predates some of the world's earliest civilizations and leaves behind a legacy of advanced urban planning, intricate social structures, and an array of intriguing artifacts.
            </p>
            <li class="liheading">
                Urban Planning and Architecture:
            </li>
            <p>
                One of the most remarkable features of the Indus Valley Civilization is its well-planned cities. Harappa and Mohenjo-Daro, the two major urban centers, displayed an advanced understanding of city planning with grid-like street layouts, sophisticated drainage systems, and multi-story buildings. The absence of monumental architecture and palaces has led historians to speculate about the civilization's egalitarian social structure.
            </p>
            <li class="liheading">
                Writing System:
            </li>
            <p>
                The Indus script, discovered on seals and pottery, remains undeciphered, adding an air of mystery to the civilization. While scholars have made efforts to crack the code, the lack of a bilingual text has made it challenging to decipher the meaning and purpose of this ancient writing system.
            </p>
            <li class="liheading">
                Economic and Agricultural Practices:
            </li>
            <p>
                The Indus Valley people were adept at agriculture, utilizing the fertile soil of the Indus River to cultivate crops such as wheat, barley, and cotton. The presence of granaries and evidence of trade with Mesopotamia suggest a prosperous economic system. The standardized weights and measures found in various sites indicate a sophisticated trade network.
            </p>
            <li class="liheading">
                Social Organization and Artistic Achievements:
            </li>
            <p>
                The social structure of the Indus Valley Civilization remains a subject of speculation. The absence of monumental structures traditionally associated with elite rule raises questions about the civilization's egalitarian nature. Artifacts like pottery, jewelry, and figurines reveal a rich artistic tradition with a focus on naturalistic representations of animals and humans.
            </p>
            <li class="liheading">
                Decline and Disappearance:
            </li>
            <p>
                The decline of the Indus Valley Civilization is a mystery that continues to puzzle historians. Theories range from environmental factors such as climate change and river course shifts to invasion and internal conflicts. The civilization gradually faded away, leaving behind deserted cities and abandoned settlements.

            <h2>Vedic Period and Early Kingdoms</h2>
            <ul>
                <li class="liheading">
                    Introduction:
                </li>
                <p>
                    The Vedic period, which spanned from approximately 1500 BCE to 500 BCE, holds a crucial place in the annals of Indian history. This era witnessed the composition of the sacred texts known as the Vedas, shaping the religious and philosophical landscape of the subcontinent. Concurrently, the emergence of early kingdoms laid the foundation for the socio-political fabric that would evolve in subsequent centuries.
                </p>
                <li class="liheading">
                    Rigveda and the Four Vedas:
                </li>
                <p>
                    The Rigveda, the oldest of the Vedas, encapsulates hymns dedicated to various deities. Over time, three additional Vedas—the Samaveda, Yajurveda, and Atharvaveda—were compiled, each serving distinct religious and ritualistic purposes.
                </p>
                <li class="liheading">
                    Social Organization and Rigvedic Society:
                </li>
                <p>
                    The Rigvedic society was organized into four varnas (social classes): Brahmins (priests), Kshatriyas (warriors), Vaishyas (merchants and farmers), and Shudras (laborers). This early social structure laid the groundwork for the later development of the caste system.
                <li class="liheading">
                    Magadha and the Rise of Kingdoms:
                </li>
                <p>
                    The Vedic period witnessed the emergence of kingdoms, notably Magadha, which played a pivotal role in shaping the political landscape. The transition from tribal communities to more centralized states marked a significant societal shift.
                </p>
                <li class="liheading">
                    Mahajanapadas and Janapadas:
                </li>
                <p>
                    The Vedic era saw the rise of Mahajanapadas, powerful and prosperous territorial states. These Mahajanapadas were further divided into smaller units called Janapadas, each with its own governance and administration.
                </p>
                <li class="liheading">
                    Economic Activities and Urbanization:
                </li>
                <p>
                    During the Vedic period, economic activities expanded, with agriculture and trade playing vital roles. The establishment of urban centers marked a departure from the earlier nomadic lifestyle, fostering cultural exchanges and economic growth.

                    The Tughlaq Dynasty, under rulers like Muhammad bin Tughlaq, attempted significant administrative reforms. However, the policies, including the shifting of the capital to Daulatabad, faced challenges and contributed to the dynasty's decline.

                    Babur, a descendant of Timur and Genghis Khan, established the Mughal Empire in India after the Battle of Panipat in 1526. His descendants, including Akbar, Jahangir, and Shah Jahan, led the empire to unprecedented heights.

                    Introduction:
                </li>
                <p>
                    The colonial era in India, marked by British rule from the 18th to the mid-20th century, witnessed significant socio-economic and political transformations. The struggle for independence, led by charismatic leaders, became a defining chapter in India's history, ultimately culminating in the birth of a sovereign nation.
                </p>
                <li class="liheading">
                    Establishment and Expansion:
                </li>
                <p>
                    The British East India Company, initially formed for trade, gradually expanded its influence. The Battle of Plassey in 1757 and the Battle of Buxar in 1764 solidified British control over vast territories.

                <li class="liheading">
                    Economic Exploitation and Policies:
                </li>
                <p>
                    The British implemented economic policies that prioritized British interests. The exploitative revenue systems, including the Permanent Settlement, adversely affected Indian farmers and contributed to economic disparities.

                <p>
                    The Sepoy Mutiny of 1857, often considered the First War of Independence, marked widespread opposition to British rule. Though it faced suppression, it sowed the seeds for future movements against colonialism.

                <li class="liheading">
                    Indian National Congress (INC):
                </li>
                <p>
                    Founded in 1885, the Indian National Congress became a crucial platform for political activism. Leaders like Dadabhai Naoroji, Bal Gangadhar Tilak, and later Mahatma Gandhi played vital roles in the struggle for independence.

                    Mahatma Gandhi, with his philosophy of non-violence (Satyagraha), led various movements such as the Salt March and Quit India Movement. His efforts, combined with the sacrifices of countless Indians, eventually led to India gaining independence on August 15, 1947.

                <p>
                    Modern India, post-independence in 1947, embarked on a journey of nation-building, economic development, and social transformation.

                    The partition of British India in 1947 led to the creation of two independent nations, India and Pakistan. The mass migrations and communal violence during this time left a profound impact on the subcontinent.

                    The Green Revolution in the 1960s and 1970s brought about significant changes in agriculture, increasing crop yields and addressing food scarcity. It played a crucial role in India's economic development.
